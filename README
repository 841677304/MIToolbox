This is the MIToolbox v1.02 for C/C++ and MATLAB/OCTAVE

It provides a series of functions for working with information theory and 
Renyi's extension to information theory. It also contains some variable 
manipulation functions to preprocess discrete/categorical variables to generate
information theoretic values from the variables. 

These functions are targeted for use with feature selection algorithms rather 
than communication channels and so expect all the data to be available before 
execution and sample their own probability distributions from the data.

Functions contained:
 - Entropy
 - Conditional Entropy
 - Mutual Information
 - Conditional Mutual Information
 - generating a joint variable
 - generating a probability distribution from a discrete random variable
 - Renyi's Entropy
 - Renyi's Mutual Information

To compile the library for use in MATLAB/OCTAVE, execute CompileScript.m
from within MATLAB, or run 'make matlab' from a linux terminal.

The C source files are licensed under the LGPL v3. The MATLAB wrappers and 
demonstration feature selection algorithms are provided as is with no warranty 
as examples of how to use the library in MATLAB.

Update History
07/07/2010 - v1.0 - Initial Release
02/09/2010 - v1.01 - Updated CMIM.m in demonstration_algorithms, due to a bug where the last feature would not be selected first if it had the highest MI
15/10/2010 - v1.02 - Fixed bug where MIToolbox would cause a segmentation fault if a x by 0 empty matrix was passed in. Now prints an error message and returns gracefully
